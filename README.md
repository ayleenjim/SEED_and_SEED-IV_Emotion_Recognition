# Emotion Recognition on EEG Data (testing methods)
Forked from @Abhishek-Iyer1

This repo experiments with preprocessing and feature extraction techniques as well as how CNN and RNN models are used for emotion recognition on EEG data. 
The SEED and SEED-IV Datasets are implemented and linked accordingly.
